This workshop aims to showcase how to modernize applications for solving the challenges faced by existing applications in the current landscape as below:

* **Integration**: Challenging to leverage new cloud based services
* **Scalability**: Not able to meet web scale due to data-centric architecture
* **Reliability**: Unable to quickly deploy new capabilities
* **Developer productivity and Business Agility**: Often low in comparison to cloud native applications

Take a look at the link:https://www.konveyor.io/modernization-report/[Konveyor Communityâ€™s Application Modernization Report for 2022] to understand how users and organizations define application modernization as well as top reasons for modernization.

## Key Takeaways

* Modernization has a broad spectrum of definitions, but containerizing and automation rank high. 
* The containerizing is a broad enough trend to encompass multiple strategies including refactoring with Microservices. 
* Increasing scalability and reliability are key reasons for modernization.

## Technology Stack

* Red Hat Runtimes (JBoss EAP, JBoss Web Server, Quarkus, Spring Boot, Node.js)
* Red Hat OpenShift (Pipeline, GitOps, Virtualization, Serverless, Service Mesh)
* Red Hat Dev Spaces
* PostgreSQL

## Documentation

This workshop is based on link:https://antora.org/[Antora] and link:https://github.com/redhat-scholars/courseware-template[Red Hat scholars template] to build HTML based tutorials.


### Lab Parameters

This lab supports both link:site.yml#L17[Antora variables] than query parameters. Query params makes the workshop content dynamic, like URLs specific for your cluster to copy and paste.

NOTE: In the table above, CRC and Playground links use them.

Here's the list of all query params used (they are all optional, but generated links won't work unless at least `CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN` is set):

[%header,cols=2*] 
|===
|PARAM
|Description

|`CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN`
|The subdomain for your OpenShift cluster in the form `apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, e.g. `apps.openshift.mydomain.tld`

|`USERNAME`
| The username of your OpenShift cluster

Example [Dev Mode]:

http://localhost:3000/mad-dev-guides-mono2micro/main/1-introduction.html?USERID=user1&SUBDOMAIN=cluster-8s5ss.sandbox701.opentlc.com&TOMCATIP=150.240.99.53
